# WaterLily-PreCICE

[WaterLily.jl](https://github.com/WaterLily-jl/WaterLily.jl) bindings to connect to the [PreCICE](https://precice.org) coupling library

## Prerequisites

Before running any coupled simulation using `WaterLily.jl` and any other package with an excisting preCICE adapter, you will need a working version of preCICE, see [here](https://precice.org/installation-overview.html) for a detailed installation guide.

## Usage

This package is a work in progress and is not yet available in the julia package registry. To use it, clone the repository and add the package to your julia environment:

```julia
] dev /path/to/WaterLilyPreCICE.jl
] instantiate
```

Then, you can use the package in your julia scripts:

```julia
using WaterLilyPreCICE
```

Running the different solvers

run `Julia`
```bash
julia --project=../../ Fluid.jl ../precice-config.xml
# preCICEJulia --project=/home/marin/Workspace/WaterLilyPreCICE/examples Fluid.jl precice-config.xml
```

run `G+Smo`
```bash
./Solid -c precice-config.xml
```

run `Calculix`
```bash
ccx_preCICE -i calculix -bg -precice-participant Calculix
```

## General approach

The approach we have to use to couple a structural solver with `WaterLily.jl` using `preCICE` is different from what you would do with classical ALE methods. Since `WaterLily.jl` is an immersed-boundary solver, there is no interface mesh readily available in the fluid solver. We follow two approaches in this package; the first one is to read the mesh as triangulated surfaces and use the `preCICE` adapter to couple this mesh to whatever type of mesh is used in the structural solver. The second approach, which can only be used from `CalculiX` and `G+Smo` coupling is to use `preCICE` to communicate that interface mesh directly from the structural solver to the fluid solver.

### Rubber Airfoil in a flow

This does not sound like a good idea, but it can actually help with gust mitigations!
