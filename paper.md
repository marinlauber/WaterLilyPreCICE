# Summary

WaterLilyPreCICE.jl is a Julia interface for the PreCICE coupling library, enables seamless fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations by integrating the WaterLily fluid solver with PreCICE's robust coupling capabilities.
This interface facilitates efficient data exchange and synchronization between WaterLily and other solvers, enhancing the accuracy and stability of FSI simulations.
The package is designed to be user-friendly, allowing researchers and engineers to easily set up and run coupled simulations involving complex interactions between fluids and structures.
By leveraging the strengths of both WaterLily and PreCICE, this interface aims to advance the field of multiphysics simulations, providing a powerful tool for studying a wide range of engineering applications.

# Statement of need

Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations are crucial for understanding the complex interplay between fluids and structures in various engineering applications, such as aerospace, civil, maritime and biomedical engineering.
However, setting up and running these simulations can be challenging due to the need for efficient data exchange and synchronization between different solvers, and often different programming languages.
WaterLilyPreCICE.jl addresses this challenge by providing a Julia interface for the PreCICE coupling library, enabling seamless integration of the WaterLily fluid solver with PreCICE's robust coupling capabilities.
This interface simplifies the process of setting up FSI simulations, allowing researchers and engineers to focus on their specific applications rather than the intricacies of coupling different solvers.
By leveraging the strengths of both WaterLily and PreCICE, WaterLilyPreCICE.jl aims to advance the field of multiphysics simulations, providing a powerful tool for studying a wide range of engineering problems involving fluid-structure interactions.
